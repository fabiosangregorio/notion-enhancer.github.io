# Code of Conduct

The notion-enhancer organisation and community are
purely for the purposes of involvement with and development
of the notion-enhancer project. Though some general discussion
may occur (e.g. in the Discord server), this community is not
a place where arguments on unrelated/divisive topics are to be
held and engaging with other members of the community should
be a respectful, harassment-free experience.

Additionally, at this point the notion-enhancer is an English-only
space. While we welcome people from all over the world, we are unable
to properly understand or moderate discussion in other languages.

## Standards

### Forbidden Content

- Disruptive, meaningless or repetitive messages (i.e. spam).
  If you would like to agree with something but do not have anything
  new to add, consider using an emoji reaction on the original message.

- Unrelated, blatant or unsolicited advertisements.

- Sexualised or unsafe/inappropriate language or imagery.

- Sharing of private information without explicit permission.

### Unaccceptable Conduct

- Acting spitefully/offensively/hatefully towards another person for any reason.

- Treating another person differently based off stereotypes of age/race/gender/religion etc.

- Targeting of other users with unwanted or repeated friend requests,
  mentions or direct messages. Respect people's personal space.

### Etiquette

- Use different repositories/channels appropriately according to their stated purposes,
  e.g. ask for help in #support instead of #general and include the required information
  when submitting a bug report (see the [Contributing](./contributing.md) guide).

- Include context in your messages and get straight to the point - i.e. never say "can someone
  help me" and wait for a response. Instead, say something like "can someone help me do \_\_\_\_\_,
  I'm on \_\_\_\_\_ and have already tried \_\_\_\_\_" (see [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/)).

- Before asking a question, read other recently sent messages and type the question's keywords
  into the search bar - more often than not, someone else has already asked and received an answer.

## Enforcement

These rules are not up for debate and their enforcement and interpretation
are up to the notion-enhancer team. This may vary from case to case, depending
on the severity and context: e.g. breaking the etiquette guidelines may only result
in a warning or the message being ignored, while personally attacking another person
may lead to a temporary ban.
