# Basic Usage

## FAQ

the themes aren't working?
if you pick a dark theme it will only be applied if notion is in dark mode,
and if you pick a light theme it will only work if notion is in light mode.
do CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+L to toggle between them.
...
i closed notion and now i can't reopen it?
check your system tray/menubar for the :enhancer: icon and click it - this means the window is hidden, but not closed, so the normal app shortcut won't do anything.
...
is this against notion's terms of service? can i get in trouble for using it?
definitely not! i contacted their support team to check, and the response was awesome:
"Thanks for taking the time to share this with us. Userscripts and userstyles are definitely
cool ideas and would be helpful for many users! ... I'll also share this with the rest of the
team to take to heart for future improvements."
